What's this?
============

This is my website template for scientific progress report websites based on [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

How does it work?
=================

-   Use `make` to compile all .Rmd files like explained in the rmarkdown [docs](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#creating-a-website).
-   Edit & use `pu.sh` shell script to push the website to your favourite webserver.

Demo?
=====

If you fork and `make` this repository, it should look something like this:

<a href ="http://toconclu.de/reports/reportr/"> ![](http://toconclu.de/reports/reportr/data/fig/reportr.png) </a>
