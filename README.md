# What's this?

This is my website template for scientific progress report websites based on 
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

# How does it work?

* Use `make` to compile all .Rmd files like explained in the rmarkdown docs.
* Edit & use `pu.sh` shell script to push the website to your favourite

# Demo?

If you fork and `make` this repository, it should look something like this:
