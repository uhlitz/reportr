# What's this?

This is my website template for scientific progress report websites based on 
[rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

# How does it work?

* Use `rmarkdown::render_site()` to compile all .Rmd files 
* Edit & use `pu.sh` shell script to push the website to your favourite webserver.

# Demo?

If you fork and `rmarkdown::render_site()` this repository, it should look something like this:
